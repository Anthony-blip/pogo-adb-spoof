Disclaimer: I'm not taking any responsability for any damage caused by this program. This will NOT prevent you from softbans, but it will make it harder to get them if you use the program correctly.

This Program takes in geographic coordinates, and teleports the users to the locations, taking into consideration the softban cooldown values, and avoids them entirely.

Requirements:

-Rooted Android phone

-TheAppNinjas GPS Joystick app: http://gpsjoystick.theappninjas.com/faq/

-ADB enabled in Developer Settings

-ADB on PC: https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip



How to use:

-Download the package from the releases and extract it into any folder.

-Download the ADB from the link above, and extract "adb.exe" , "AdbWinApi.dll" ; "AdbWinUsbApi.dll" ONLY, and place them in the folder you created above.

-Run the program and follow the instructions.


Hover over the Steps which explains how the app actually works.

PS.: I know it has bugs. But it works. If you need any other changes, feel free to fork this and make your own changes, but I would like kindly to ask if you share this program somewhere, please use this github page to do so for future updates.

Thank you and have fun!
